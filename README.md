# Federated Learning for distributed databases

Based on [fl-official-statistcs](https://github.com/joshua-stock/fl-official-statistics) this repo investigates further the feasability of Federated Learning for Official Statistics.


## Setup
- **OS**: Linux is superior in convenience and stability. 
    - A WSL (Windows-Subsystem Linux) is a convienient solution for Windows.
- **Virtual environment**: both, conda or venv, work fine. Conda is used here.
- **Versions**
    - Python 3.9.* is recommended here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip



### Development environment
---

We use Tensorflow Federated (TFF). For further development e.g. is considerded 

#### OS - Linux is recommended

##### Windows restrictions

Tensorflow (TF) and Tensorflow Federated (TFF) have only restricted Windows support, e.g.

- **TFF - several problems**, e.g.
  - installing TFF does run infinitely because of not resolvable dependencies, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69949143/tensorflow-federated-on-windows
  - needed JAX has no Windows support, see https://github.com/google/jax/issues/438. JAX Team:
    
    >*Windows support is still not on the agenda. We're maxed out on other things, and moreover no one on the JAX team is a Windows user, which only makes development harder.*
  - XLA (JAX dependency) was not fully compilable, but should now be available since TF 2.2.0.
- **TF - no GPU support**, s. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-native
  
  > *Starting with TensorFlow 2.11, you will need to install TensorFlow in WSL2, or install tensorflow or tensorflow-cpu and, optionally, try the TensorFlow-DirectML-Plugin.*

##### Windows-Subsystem for Linux

**A Windows-Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can be a convenient solution**, see

- Install Tensorflow using a WSL: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#windows-wsl2
- tutorial for setting up GPU support: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S81koZpwPA&t=518s&pp=ygUOd3NsIHRlbnNvcmZsb3c%3D
- General development environment in VSCode using WSL: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl

##### MacOS restrictions

TFF is not fully available for MacOS, e.g. ...
- only outdated versions are available, see https://github.com/tensorflow/federated/issues/3881
- installation is complicated and partly sketchy, see
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66705900/can-tensorflow-federated-be-installed-on-apple-silicon-m1
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71839866/can-anyone-give-me-a-comprehensive-guide-to-installing-tensorflow-federated-on-m1
  - https://discuss.tensorflow.org/t/update-tensorflow-federated-to-match-tensorflow-macos-2-7-0-and-tensorflow-metal-0-3-0/7193/10

more possible environment (e.g. local, R-Server) tba.

#### Virtual environment

**Recommended virtual environments**

1. environment by ``conda`` using Python 3.9.* for TensorFlow, see [Install TensorFlow with pip](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) (works fine for Tensorflow Federated)
2. environment by ``venv``, see [Install TensorFlow Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/install)


#### Versions

- Python 3.9.* is recommended here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip
    - rem.: [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/) is convenient to manage python versions. 
- to reproduce the used environment use (recommended):
    - ``!pip install -r ../requirements.txt``
- to install a new similiar environment use:
    - ``pip install --upgrade tensorflow-federated``  
    - simlilarly install further helpful packages

For the full list of install packages see [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt). E.g. the following tensorflow[...] versions are used.


### Google Colab

Required:

- google account with
- connected google colab


Open a new notebook in Google Colab. This starts a new session (called runtime) with nothing installed or available in memory. S. [How to use Google Colaboratory to clone a GitHub Repository to your Google Drive? (Medium)](https://medium.com/@ashwindesilva/how-to-use-google-colaboratory-to-clone-a-github-repository-e07cf8d3d22b). Optionally a google drive can be mounted to backup a repo-version.

#### Pull this repo

```python
import os

# rm repo from gdrive
if os.path.exists("fl-official-statistics-addon"):
  %rm -r fl-official-statistics-addon

# clone
!git clone https://github.com/Olhaau/fl-official-statistics-addon

# pull (the currenct version of the repo)
!git pull
```

#### Push changes

After you have made changes to your notebook, you can commit and push them to the repository. To do so from within a Colab notebook, click File â†’ Save a copy in GitHub. You will be prompted to add a commit message, and after you click OK, the notebook will be pushed to your repository (s. https://bebi103a.github.io/lessons/02/git_with_colab.html). 

For possible solutions from within a notebook s. [stackoverflow/how-to-push-from-colab-to-github](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59454990/how-to-push-from-colab-to-github).

## Repo Structure

### _dev

Main development code can be found here as jupyter-notebooks. Currently available:

#### 01_insurance_prep_eda_baselines

For the medical insurance data, this notebook contains the preprocessing, EDA and baselines by classical ML-algorithms. To fastly calculate the baselines, AutoML is used, e.g. pycaret and TPOT.

#### 02_insurance_DNN

Tests the performance of deep neural networks (DNN) for a centralized (non federated approach) as another baseline. Further experiments try to improve the performance, stablize the training and investigates regional differences in the datasets.

#### 03_insurance_federated

tba: Federated Learning for the medical insurance data.

### Other folders

- **output:** processed data, generated plots and reports
- **archive:** some raw notebooks. Relevant code will in the future be transfered to _dev.
- **doc:** contains notes on meetings.

* lte_hyperparametersearch.ipynb: A hyperparametersearch for different models
* umlaut_lte.py: A python module containing some functions used by the notebooks
